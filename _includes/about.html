                <p> SpaceX’s Starlink, OneWeb, Amazon Kuiper and many others are sending thousands small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to offer very low latency, high capacity global broadband coverage. </p>

                <p> Despite these promises, an in-depth study on the performance of these LEO satellite mega-constellations is still missing. In this project, we will conduct a user-centralized measurement campaign to assess and evaluate the performance of SpaceX’s Starlink broadband service. </p>

                <p> Interested participants are encouraged to download the extension from here and contribute to the research study </p>
