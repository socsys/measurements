                <p> SpaceX’s Starlink, OneWeb, Amazon Kuiper and many others are sending thousands small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to offer very low latency, high capacity global broadband coverage. Despite these promises, an in-depth study on the performance of these LEO satellite mega-constellations is still missing. In this project, we will conduct a user-centralized measurement campaign to assess and evaluate the performance of SpaceX’s Starlink broadband service. Starlink’s 1800+ LEO satellites are the largest operating satellite fleet, providing a global broadband coverage for US, Canada and part of Europe. Thus, performing a measurement study on Starlink’s service will unveil some insights that can be generalised to other LEO mega- constellations.  <p>
