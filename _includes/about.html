                <p> SpaceX’s Starlink, OneWeb, Amazon Kuiper and many others are sending thousands small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to offer very low latency, high capacity global broadband coverage. </p>

                <p> Despite these promises, an in-depth study on the performance of these LEO satellite mega-constellations is still missing. In this project, we will conduct a user-centralized measurement campaign to assess and evaluate the performance of SpaceX’s Starlink broadband service. </p>

                <p> Interested participants are encouraged to download the extension from here and contribute to the research study </p>

            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

              <p> By default, the measured data will be stored locally (i.e., at your web browser) and you will be asked if you are willing to share the results. Specifically, the users will be given three different data sharing options:  <p1>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>Share the measured performance metrics (i.e., data rates, latency, etc) only</p> </li>
                  <li><p>Share the measured performance metric as well as the user’s coarse-grained location (e.g., city)</p>  </li>
                  <li><p>Share the measured performance metric as well as the user’s fine-grained location (e.g., Lat/Long)</p>  </li>
                </ul>

              <p> The extension is not collecting any personally identifiable data (e.g., name, email, etc). Any sensitive information (e.g., location), if collected, will be anonymized </p>
